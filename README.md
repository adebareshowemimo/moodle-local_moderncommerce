# ModernCommerce for Moodle

ModernCommerce is an open-source commerce platform built natively for Moodle. It lets training providers sell courses, bundles, programs, and subscriptions without requiring a separate WordPress or ecommerce installation.

ModernCommerce was created by Adebare Showemimo and is maintained by [Agunfon Interactivity LLC, USA](https://agunfoninteractivity.com). Official implementation, managed services, and commercial support are available through [ModernCommerce support](https://moderncommerce.dev/support).

## Features

- Product catalog for courses, bundles, programs, and subscription plans
- Configurable prices, sale pricing, inventory, categories, tags, and attributes
- Cart, checkout, orders, invoices, refunds, coupons, and tax handling
- Stripe, PayPal, Paystack, and Flutterwave payment gateways
- Signed payment webhooks, payment-event tracking, and diagnostic logs
- Automatic Moodle enrolment, access entitlements, and prepaid enrolment keys
- Subscription trials, recurring billing, retries, plan changes, and access synchronization
- Configurable storefront pages, widgets, branding, and email templates
- Learner dashboards for courses, certificates, grades, orders, wishlists, and subscriptions
- Reviews, notifications, abandoned-cart recovery, reports, and audit logs
- Optional integrations for Course Reminder and Enrolment Notifier add-ons

## Requirements

- Moodle 5.2
- PHP 8.3 or later
- Composer 2
- Moodle cron configured
- HTTPS for production payment gateways and webhooks

The Moodle component name is `local_moderncommerce`. The first public open-source release is `1.0.0`.

## Installation

1. Place the plugin in `local/moderncommerce` within the Moodle installation.
2. Install production dependencies from the plugin directory:

   ```bash
   composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
   ```

3. Visit Moodle site administration to complete the installation, or run:

   ```bash
   php admin/cli/upgrade.php --non-interactive
   ```

4. Configure the plugin under `Site administration > Plugins > Local plugins > Modern Commerce`.
5. Ensure Moodle cron runs regularly before enabling payments or subscriptions.

For a new installation, seed safe default configuration with:

```bash
php local/moderncommerce/cli/demo_data.php --install-defaults
```

Use `--seed` only on demo or staging systems. Never reset or seed sample orders on a production site.

## Development

From the plugin directory:

```bash
composer install
composer run mc:check-fast
node styles/tools/build-design-system.mjs --check
```

React and AMD assets are built from the Moodle checkout root with Moodle's Grunt tasks.

The complete maintainer procedure for versioning, validating, packaging, tagging, and publishing releases is in [PUBLISHING.txt](PUBLISHING.txt).

Routine repository, dependency, security, testing, documentation, and operational maintenance is documented in [MAINTAINING.md](MAINTAINING.md).
