## Documentation Standards

Modern Commerce documentation follows these rules:

- Use `local_moderncommerce` consistently and avoid legacy component names.
- Prefer absolute plugin paths such as `/local/moderncommerce/admin/orders.php` when documenting Moodle routes.
- Keep user guides task-focused and short.
- Keep generated or source-derived material in `docs/reference/`.
- Document command-line examples from the Moodle root unless stated otherwise.
- Avoid publishing secrets, test gateway keys, webhook signing secrets, or personal data in examples.

## Version

This documentation targets Modern Commerce `2.1.6` on Moodle `5.2`.
